 *
 * Rule-10.7: If a composite expression is used as one operand of an operator in
 *            which the usual arithmetic conversions are performed then the
 *            other operand shall not have wider essential type
 *
 * Implemented by message(s):
 *   1890   A composite expression of 'essentially signed' type (%1s) is
 *          being implicitly converted to a wider signed type, '%2s'.
 *
 *   1891   A composite expression of 'essentially unsigned' type (%1s) is
 *          being implicitly converted to a wider unsigned type,
 *          '%2s'.
 *
 *   1892   A composite expression of 'essentially floating' type (%1s) is
 *          being implicitly converted to a wider floating type,
 *          '%2s'.
 *
 *   1893   The 2nd and 3rd operands of this conditional operator are both
 *          'essentially signed' ('%1s' and '%2s') but one is a
 *          composite expression of a narrower type than the other.
 *
 *   1894   The 2nd and 3rd operands of this conditional operator are both
 *          'essentially unsigned' ('%1s' and '%2s') but one is a
 *          composite expression of a narrower type than the other.
 *
 *   1895   The 2nd and 3rd operands of this conditional operator are both
 *          'essentially floating' ('%1s' and '%2s') but one is a
 *          composite expression of a narrower type than the other.
