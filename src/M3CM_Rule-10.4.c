 * Rule-10.4: Both operands of an operator in which the usual arithmetic
 *            conversions are performed shall have the same essential type
 *            category
 *
 * Implemented by message(s):
 *   1800   The %1s operand (essential type: '%2s') will be implicitly
 *          converted to a floating type, '%3s', in this arithmetic
 *          operation.
