 * Rule-10.3: The value of an expression shall not be assigned to an object with a
 *            narrower essential type or of a different essential type category.
 *
 * Implemented by message(s):

 *
 *   1299   An integer constant of 'essentially unsigned' type is being
 *          converted to floating type on assignment.
 *
 *   2850   Constant: Implicit conversion to a signed integer type of

 *
 *   2890   Constant: Negative value implicitly converted to an unsigned
