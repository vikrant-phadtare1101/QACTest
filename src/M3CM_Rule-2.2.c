 * Rule-2.2: There shall be no dead code
 *
 * Implemented by message(s):
 *   2980   The value of this function parameter is never used before being
 *          modified.
 *
 *   2981   This initialization is redundant. The value of this object is
 *          never used before being modified.
 *
 *   2982   This assignment is redundant. The value of this object is never
 *          used before being modified.
 *
 *   2983   This assignment is redundant. The value of this object is never
 *          subsequently used.
 *
 *   2985   This operation is redundant. The value of the result is always
 *          that of the left-hand operand.
 *
 *   2986   This operation is redundant. The value of the result is always
 *          that of the right-hand operand.
 *
 *   2987   This function call produces no side effects and is redundant.
 *
 *   2995   The result of this logical operation is always 'true'.
 *
 *   2996   The result of this logical operation is always 'false'.
 *
 *   3110   The left-hand operand of this ',' has no side effects.
 *
 *   3112   This statement has no side-effect - it can be removed.
 *
 *   3404   Statement contains a redundant * operator at top level. *p++
 *          means *(p++) not (*p)++.
 *
 *   3422   Statement contains a redundant operator at top level.
 *
 *   3423   Statement contains a redundant cast at top level.
 *
 *   3424   Statement contains a redundant & or | at top level.
 *
 *   3425   One branch of this conditional operation is a redundant
 *          expression.
 *
 *   3426   Right hand side of comma expression has no side effect and its
 *          value is not used.
 *
 *   3427   Right hand side of logical operator has no side effect and its
 *          value is not used.
